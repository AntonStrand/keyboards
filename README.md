# Keyboards

I wanted an easy way to keep track of my keyboards and keymaps in one place but still be able to easily compile and flash them.

This repo is inspired by this [blog post](https://medium.com/@patrick.elmquist/separate-keymap-repo-for-qmk-136ff5a419bd) by Patrick Elmquist.

Currently I only have QMK right now but I chose this structure in case I get a bluetooth keyboard and need ZMK.

## Usage

See each sub directory.
